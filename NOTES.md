These are some post mortem notes from the TAs about this assignment.


There are several things that need changing:
The generateVanityKey problem should be in its own file.

The section entitled Generate a Vanity Key should be renamed to Generate Vanity Address

A small go program that computes the fibonacci sequence of 23 or so should be a required problem

The funding of the vanity address transaction should also send coins to other sutudents. And there should be a question about the total coins input and the total coins output.


The command line script could be more verbose in its output and -address should be -toaddress
